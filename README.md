# Blockchain
 
The project is a software development project that involved building a Blockchain API in Python using Flask, a popular web framework. The project aimed to provide an API interface for users to interact with a blockchain network. The project required the acquisition of knowledge about cryptography, blockchain technology, and how it can be implemented and deployed in various sectors.

The implementation of the project involved creating a secure data structure for storing transaction data called the Merkle Tree. The Merkle Tree is a binary tree data structure that allows for secure and efficient storage of transaction data. It is used in many blockchain implementations to ensure the integrity of data and to prevent data tampering.

After building the Blockchain API and implementing the Merkle Tree data structure, the project was tested on different systems on the same network. This testing phase ensured that the API was functional and could handle different types of requests from users. Additionally, testing was done to ensure that the API was secure and that data stored on the blockchain was protected from unauthorized access or tampering.

Overall, the project involved acquiring knowledge about blockchain technology, cryptography, and data structures, as well as implementing a functional and secure Blockchain API using Python and Flask.
